##Introduction

This is a brief documentation about BeaconLED. But what's is it? 

The idea of BeaconLED is to allow you trigger a specific Bluetooth LE Device (4.0) when you get into certain Range. This project contains two parts, one is the programm for hardware device (arduino) with Bluetooth 4.0 BLE module, and another part is a software application running on an android smartphone.
